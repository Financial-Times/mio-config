Thus they should contain nothing new to most developers, ruby or not.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIn your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'mio-config', github: 'financial-times/mio-config.git'\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\r\ngem 'mio-config'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n`mio-config` relies on the config file: `./config/mio.yml`, which must live in the root of your project. It looks like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n----\r\nbase_url: https://my-mio.example.com\r\nusername: admin\r\npassword: passwd\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** this may also be templated- it uses [ERB](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) under the hood.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n----\r\nbase_url: <%= ENV.fetch('MIO_URL', 'https://my-mio.example.com' %>\r\nusername: admin\r\npassword: <%= File.read( \"#{ENV.fetch('HOME')}/.passwd\" ) %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nWe expose a couple of rake tasks:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bundle exec rake -T\r\nrake mio:migrate                     # Handle migrations (via mio:migrate:up)\r\nrake mio:migrate:create[model,desc]  # Create a new migration\r\nrake mio:migrate:up                  # Run migrations\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Create migrations\r\n\r\nYou're more than welcome to handcraft these- they're pretty simple. You may, though, use the skeleton we create:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bundle exec rake mio:migrate:create[s3,'create an s3 bucket for ingestion']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** There is a lack of spaces around stuff on purpose. Rake gets a bit funny with them in.\r\n\r\nThis rake taks will look at the model and pre-populate the necessary arguments. From there any *Plain Ol' Ruby* will work. Probably.\r\n\r\n#### Handcrafting\r\n\r\nModels have a series of fields they expect to exist; a developer may see these by looking in the directory `lib/mio/model`. To create an s3 bucket resource as above, and after looking in this file, we end up with something similar to:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmigrate 'create an s3 bucket for ingestion' do\r\n  s3 do |s|\r\n    s.name = 'My S3 Bucket'\r\n    s.visibility = [32444]\r\n    s.key = 'S3-KEY'\r\n    # Snip\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nThis project was built and tested with ruby 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nTo install this via rbenv:\r\n\r\n### OSX\r\n```bash\r\n$ # Install rbenv if not installed\r\n$ brew install rbenv\r\n$ echo 'eval \"$(rbenv init -)\" ' >> ~/.bash_proile\r\n$ Install ruby 2.3.0\r\n$ rbenv install 2.3.0\r\n$ # Either set as global version:\r\n$ rbenv global 2.3.0\r\n$ # Or install as local to this project:\r\n$ rbenv local 2.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other environments\r\n\r\nrbenv may be installed via your package manager or from [github](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building etc\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Adding models\r\n\r\nAny model added to `lib/mio/model` will be autoloaded. The final class name becomes the caller method:\r\n\r\nA model called:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Mio\r\n  class Model\r\n    class Foo\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill, then, be accessible by the helper method `foo`.\r\n\r\nA migration would look like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmigrate 'a simple test` do\r\n  foo do\r\n    #blah\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Helper methods\r\n\r\nModels define a `resource` and a set of `fields`. The resource is the path appended to `base_uri`; with `example.com/api/workflows` `example.com` is the `base_uri` and `workflows` is the `resource`. (The `/api` path is added in the gem).\r\n\r\nThe `s3` model, for example, looks a little like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Mio\r\n  class Model\r\n    class S3 < Model\r\n      set_resource :resources\r\n      field :name, String, /^(?!\\s*$).+/\r\n# SNIP\r\n```\r\n\r\n`#field` has the signature:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef field key, type, desc, default=nil, matcher=nil\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2016, Financial Times\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
